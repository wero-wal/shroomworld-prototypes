# Shroomworld Prototypes
Prototypes of mechanics and features for [my A-Level project](https://github.com/wero-wal/shroomworld).

## Quest prototype

Demonstrates...
1. how users will acquire quests from NPCs
2. how the quest menu will be accessed
3. what information will be displayed on the quest menu

## Terrain generation prototype

1. Models generation of hills and caves using the Perlin noise algorithm.
2. Displays this terrain

## Movement prototype

Note: I used this to get comfortable with using MonoGame and familiarising myself with the scale of the coordinates.
1. Use WASD keys to move a player around the screen.

## Physics prototype

1. Use WAS keys to move a player around the screen. Simplistic rigid body physics apply.
2. Player should not be able to pass through solid objects.
